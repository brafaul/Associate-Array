The main purpose of this program is to use an associative array to store a set of values and sort them based on a key word. The user can add new values, find values, remove values, find the smallest value, and the largest key word. The user can also print out the array to the screen or write it out to a file in order of smallest to largest key. I didn't manage to overload the []operator.
